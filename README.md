Discalimer: This is a project from the online course "Node with React: Fullstack Web Development". Although the code was written by me, it was mostly a code along of the course; hence, this is not a personal project and I have no claim over the project

About: This project lets a user create a survey and send the surveys to selected email recipients.

Description: This is a full stack web application that uses the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Node) stack. For the authentication of the user, we have used Google OAuth. we have also used SendGrid as our email provider.
